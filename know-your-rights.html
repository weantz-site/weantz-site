    <h1>Know Your Rights — United States</h1>
    <p class="section">This page provides plain-language, nationwide guidance to help you protect your rights when interacting with police, immigration enforcement (ICE), or other authorities. This is general information, not legal advice. If you need legal help, contact a licensed attorney or one of the organizations listed below.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Quick summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You have the right to remain silent — you can politely say you wish to remain silent.</li>
        <li>You have the right to refuse consent to a search of your person, belongings, or home in many circumstances. Ask to see a warrant before allowing entry.</li>
        <li>You have the right to an attorney. If detained or arrested, ask for a lawyer immediately and do not answer questions without one.</li>
        <li>Do not lie or provide false documents. Carry ID if you choose, but know your rights about whether you must show it in your state.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>If police stop you (street or traffic stop)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Stay calm and keep your hands visible.</li>
        <li>You may ask: "Am I free to go?" If the officer says yes, calmly walk away.</li>
        <li>If you are not free to go (you are being detained or arrested), say: "I choose to remain silent. I want to speak to a lawyer."</li>
        <li>Do not resist, even if you believe the stop is unlawful — resisting can lead to additional charges. You can challenge unlawful conduct later in court with a lawyer.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>If immigration enforcement (ICE) comes to your home or stops you</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask to see a judicial warrant — ICE needs a judge-signed warrant to enter a home without consent (determine local law applicability; administrative warrants are different).</li>
        <li>Do not consent to entry or searches without a warrant. If officers claim they have a warrant, ask to step outside and show it — do not invite them in.</li>
        <li>If detained, say: "I wish to remain silent. I want to speak to a lawyer." Ask to speak to your consulate if you are not a U.S. citizen.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>At airports, checkpoints, and border crossings</h2>
      <p>Different rules can apply at borders and ports of entry. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has broader authority. If you are a U.S. citizen, you generally have rights but may be subject to questioning. Non-citizens have additional considerations; consult a lawyer if possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What to do if someone is detained or arrested</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Get as much information as you can: names, badge numbers, agency, location where the person is taken.</li>
        <li>Contact a local immigration legal provider or an attorney immediately. Use the national resources below if you don’t have a lawyer.</li>
        <li>Do not sign anything without an attorney present.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Recording and documenting encounters</h2>
      <p>In most U.S. states you may record police and immigration officers in public spaces where you can legally be. Avoid interfering with officers’ actions. If you record, try to capture badge numbers, license plates, and take notes about what happened.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Safety scripts (short things to say)</h2>
      <p>If you want to remain silent: "I am going to remain silent. I want to speak to a lawyer."</p>
      <p>If someone at your door: "I do not consent to entry without a judicial warrant. Please slide the warrant under the door or step outside to show it."</p>
